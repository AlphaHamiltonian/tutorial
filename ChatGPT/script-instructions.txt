I need the following:
1. A script in python that takes in a folder with *.json files and modify the "checkTickersFrequency" to 10000 if the "assetSymbol" ends in USDT and modifies it to be 90000 otherwise.
2. the original folder is in: /home/yahweh/code/ah/config/config/
3. the new folder is in : /home/yahweh/code/ah/config/output/
4. It should save all of the new config in the new folder with only the changed modification
5. If there are no "checkTickersFrequency" then add the field in the correct location and have the correct values based on #1
6. attached are samples of the json files
